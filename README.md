Cliffster - The Chrome Extension for Quick Text Access


Overview
Cliffster is a Chrome extension designed to simplify the job application process by allowing you to store frequently used text snippets and access them quickly without switching between tabs. Say goodbye to tedious tab-hopping and copying from multiple sources. With Cliffster, you can copy and paste stored text with just a few clicks, making your workflow more efficient and focused.

Motivation
When applying for jobs, I often had to switch between tabs to find answers to common questions, such as my GitHub URL, portfolio website, LinkedIn profile, or even answers to common job interview questions. The traditional process was tedious: seeing a question, switching tabs to find the answer, copying it, and then pasting it into the desired field. I knew there had to be a better way.

That's why I created Cliffster. This extension lets you save commonly used text snippets, making the job application process faster and more seamless.

Features
Store Text Snippets: Keep all your frequently used text snippets in one place.
Quick Access: Retrieve stored text with just a few clicks.
Clipboard Integration: Copy stored text to your clipboard with a single click.
Customizable: Easily add, remove, and manage your text snippets.
Installation
Open Google Chrome.
Go to the Chrome Web Store.
Click "Add to Chrome."
Confirm by clicking "Add Extension."
Usage
Click on the Cliffster icon in your Chrome toolbar.
Select a saved snippet to copy it to your clipboard.
Paste the copied text into the desired field.
This process streamlines what used to be a four-step process:

See the question in one tab.
Switch to another tab to find the answer.
Copy the answer.
Paste the answer into the desired field.
With Cliffster, you can get the text you need with just three clicks: click on the extension, click on the desired snippet, and then paste it.
