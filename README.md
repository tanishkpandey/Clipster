# Clipster - The Chrome Extension for Quick Text Access

## Overview
Clipster is a Chrome extension designed to simplify the job application process by allowing you to store frequently used text snippets and access them quickly without switching between tabs. Say goodbye to tedious tab-hopping and copying from multiple sources. With Clipster, you can copy and paste stored text with just a few clicks, making your workflow more efficient and focused.

## Motivation
Applying for jobs often involves switching between tabs, copying information, and pasting it into job applications. This process is repetitive and time-consuming. I created Clipster to streamline this process by allowing you to store and access frequently used text snippets quickly and efficiently.

## Features
- **Store Text Snippets**: Keep your most-used text snippets in one place.
- **Quick Access**: Retrieve stored text with just a few clicks.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Copy stored text to your clipboard with a single click.
- **Customizable**: Easily add, remove, and manage your text snippets.

## Installation
To install and use Clipster without the Chrome Web Store, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the Clipster repository to your local machine.
2. **Open Google Chrome**: Launch Google Chrome on your computer.
3. **Go to the Extensions Page**: Click on the three-dot menu in the top right corner, then go to "More tools" > "Extensions."
4. **Enable Developer Mode**: In the Extensions page, turn on the "Developer mode" toggle in the top right corner.
5. **Load Unpacked Extension**: Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder where you cloned the Clipster repository.
6. **Launch Clipster**: Once the extension is loaded, you should see the Clipster icon in your Chrome toolbar. Click on it to open and start using it.

## Usage
1. Click on the Clipster icon in your Chrome toolbar.
2. Select a saved snippet to copy it to your clipboard.
3. Paste the copied text into the desired field.

Clipster reduces a traditional four-step process (seeing a question, switching tabs, copying the text, and pasting it) to just three clicks: click on the extension, select the desired snippet, and paste it.
