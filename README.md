# Cliffster - The Chrome Extension for Quick Text Access

## Overview
Cliffster is a Chrome extension designed to simplify the job application process by allowing you to store frequently used text snippets and access them quickly without switching between tabs. No more tedious tab-hopping and copying from multiple sources. With Cliffster, you can copy and paste stored text with just a few clicks, making your workflow more efficient and focused.

## Motivation
Applying for jobs often means switching between tabs, searching for answers to common questions, and then copying and pasting the text into job applications. This process is cumbersome, repetitive, and prone to mistakes. That's why I created Cliffsterâ€”an extension that stores frequently used text snippets, making job applications easier, faster, and more seamless.

## Features
- **Store Text Snippets**: Keep your most-used text snippets in one place.
- **Quick Access**: Retrieve stored text with just a few clicks.
- **Clipboard Integration**: Copy stored text to your clipboard with a single click.
- **Customizable**: Easily add, remove, and manage your text snippets.

## Installation
1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Go to the [Chrome Web Store](YOUR_EXTENSION_URL).
3. Click "Add to Chrome."
4. Confirm by clicking "Add Extension."

## Usage
1. Click on the Cliffster icon in your Chrome toolbar.
2. Select a saved snippet to copy it to your clipboard.
3. Paste the copied text into the desired field.

Cliffster reduces a traditional four-step process (seeing a question, switching tabs, copying the text, and pasting it) to just three clicks: click on the extension, select the desired snippet, and paste it.
